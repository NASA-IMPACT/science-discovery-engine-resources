# Science Discovery Engine Resources
Empowering open science, the [Science Discovery Engine](https://sciencediscoveryengine.nasa.gov/) allows you to explore the universe, from the tiniest of cells to the vastness of space, through discovery of NASA's science data, documentation, and code.

NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) seeks to expand human knowledge through new scientific discoveries in order to understand the sun, Earth, solar system, and universe. Each of the five science topic areas within SMD (Astrophysics, Biological & Physical Science, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary Science) generate, analyze, and archive large amounts of data. In order to foster an [open source science culture](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/), NASA makes these data openly available to millions of users around the world. To make these data more fully open, NASA built the Science Discovery Engine (SDE) to enable discovery and access to scientific data across topic areas. 

This GitHub repository contains resources developed by the SDE team. These resources were developed to support the functionality and performance of the SDE but may be of value to the wider scientific data stewardship community. Community feedback and comments on these resources are encouraged and welcomed.
